Data analysis and visualization of a neutron star binary-system's Gravitational Waves

Supervised by Dr Prof Rajesh Nayak (IISER Kolkata) under GW Workshop at NSSC, IIT Kharagpur.

Data analysis of a compact binary system (black hole / neutron star) by modeling the linear combination of gravitational wave polarizations. The wave signal is computed as a real-time series and expressed as function of time-variant amplitude and phase. The analysis applies Fourier transformation and Gaussian normalization to wave signals, and provides data visualization for amplitude, phase, wave-signal and noise.
